### Features

* An Express server setup which both serves the React app and API requests
* Example of an API call from the client to the server using Redux and Redux Thunk, rendering the results in the client
* React Router v4 configuration, navigating between pages, and showing a 'not found' page
* Uses Styled Components to describe component styles in JavaScript
* Hot reloading of both server and client changes
* Ready for production deploy to Heroku
* Example of importing static images in JavaScript
* ESLint configuration
* Google Fonts and Twitter Bootstrap v4 integration

### Installation

1. Clone this repo using `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/JamesBoadi/FinerVision_Application.git`
2. Move to the appropriate directory: `cd react-redux-express-boilerplate`
3. Install server and client dependencies: `yarn install-dev`
4. Start the application from the project directory: `yarn dev` or start the 
   React app on its own from the `./client` directory: `yarn start`

### Connecting to the Database

This project was developed using MySQL 8, to connect to the database, navigate to the `.env` file and change the credentials

Navigate to the directory that contains the SQL files `cd stored_procedures`. These files can either be
run using a query engine, or a command line running SQL to perform actions like creating the database or granting permissions 

On UNIX systems, SQL scripts can be run using the following command

`mysql -u user -p < create_table.sql`

then

`mysql -u user -p 'user_info' < store_user_data.sql`

Make sure that the schema is created first and that all users have appropiate permissions

### Express and React

In this project Express both serves the React files and API requests.

In development, server requests from the React app are proxied to the server. Take a look at the `proxy` field in `./client/package.json` to see where this is set up.
